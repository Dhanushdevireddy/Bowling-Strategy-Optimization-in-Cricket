## Dataset

Download the dataset used in the project from the following GitHub repository:

ðŸ”— [https://github.com/ritesh-ojha/T20-World-Cup-Dataset](https://github.com/ritesh-ojha/T20-World-Cup-Dataset)

Save the required CSV files in the root directory of the project.

## Pre-trained Models

Download the pre-trained models (Random Forest, XGBoost, and MLP) from this Google Drive link:

ðŸ”— [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mg0Uq2rzXsjO6OxLMH0p9rpApDtdTJgw/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mg0Uq2rzXsjO6OxLMH0p9rpApDtdTJgw/view?usp=sharing)

Place the downloaded models in the respective model folders (MLP, Random\_Forest, XGBoost) as required by their inference scripts.

## Installation

To install all necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

Launch the notebooks to explore training, evaluation, and ablation studies:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

There is no eval.py script as there was no benchmark model used in this project. Instead, evaluation is handled within the respective notebooks.

## Models Implemented

* Random Forest
* XGBoost
* Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Each model comes with training and inference scripts, and has been evaluated qualitatively and through ablation experiments.
